OWLBASE - because i like owls

WHAT IS THIS?
changing owls.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
its a simple bash script that picks one ascii file from
the integrated folder ('owlbase') and prints it in
.currentowl
you can then print it.

ITS NOT WORKING!!!
check if you have the correct paths.
then file a bug at
https://github.com/HackedPixels/owlbase.git
thanks.
